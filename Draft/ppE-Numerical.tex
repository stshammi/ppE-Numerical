\section{Introduction}
%GWs & their  importance in testing gravity
General relativity (GR) is the most successful theory of gravitation to date. This century-old theory that exquisitely describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime has passed numerous tests with high precision~\cite{Will:2014kxa}. Nonetheless, GR is not expected to be a complete description of gravity. The inconsistency in  galaxy rotation curves~\cite{article,Bosma:1981zz,Begeman:1991iy,Rubin:1970zza,Rubin:1980zd,1973ApJ...186..467O,Ostriker:1993fr} and the accelerated expansion of the universe~\cite{Abbott:1988nx,Copeland:2006wr,Perlmutter:1998np,Riess:1998cb,Riess:2004nr,RevModPhys.61.1,vanAlbada:1984js,WEINBERG201387}  is difficult to explain within the formulation of GR without introducing dark matter and dark energy. Moreover, a new theory is required to reconcile quantum mechanics with classical gravity~\cite{Adler:2010wf,Ng:2003jk}. Hence, one needs to continue testing GR through various experiments and observations. Gravitational wave (GW) observations are the recent addition to this venture~\cite{TheLIGOScientific:2016src,Yunes:2016jcc,LIGOScientific:2019fpa,Monitor:2017mdv,Abbott:2018lct} which enabled us to probe the formerly inaccessible strong, highly nonlinear and dynamical regime of gravity. Since strong-field regime is precisely the place to look for evidence of beyond-GR phenomenona due to quantum gravity corrections, it is important to extract as much physics as possible from the available GW data. 



\begin{comment}
%Current and future status of GW astrophysics
During the first two LIGO/Virgo observing runs, ten binary black hole mergers and one neutron star merger were confirmed~\cite{LIGOScientific:2018mvr}. Recently LIGO recommenced the hunt for gravitational waves with a third observing run after going through multiple upgrades~\cite{Ligo_News}.
With KAGRA in Japan near its completion~\cite{Akutsu:2018axf} and LIGO-India under active study~\cite{LIGOScientific:2019vkc}, a stronger ground-based gravitational wave network will be realized in the next five years.
%In 2025 LIGO-India will join the global network of detectors
The third generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will provide us with improved sensitivities~\cite{Evans:2016mbw,Punturo:2010zz}.
The space-based detector LISA~\cite{Audley:2017drz} will inaugurate around mid-2030's and will be able to observe GWs at much lower frequency.
%Decigo~\cite{Kawamura:2011zz} and BBO~\cite{Corbin:2005ny}
With more detectors joining the quest we will achieve better precision in parameter estimation and source localization.

\section{Methodology}\label{section:method}

In this section, we explain how we perform our analysis. We first explain the PPE formalism and non-GR waveform template. We then describe the Fisher analysis and how we construct probability distributions of non-GR parameters.

%------------------------------
\subsection{PPE Waveform}\label{section:ppE}
%Introduction
We begin by reviewing the PPE formalism briefly. PPE gravitational waveform for a compact binary inspiral in the frequency domain is given by~\cite{Yunes:2009ke}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2a}
\tilde{h}(f)=\tilde{h}_{\GR}(1+\alpha_{\PPE}\, u^a)e^{i\delta\Psi}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{h}_{\GR}$ is the gravitational waveform in GR. $\alpha_{\PPE}\, u^a$ to the GW amplitude with $u\equiv(\pi \mathcal{M} f)^{1/3}$.  $\mathcal{M}\equiv(m_1m_2)^{3/5}/(m_1+m_2)^{1/5}$ is the chirp mass with component masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ and $f$ is the frequency of the GW. The constant $\alpha_{\PPE}$ controls the overall magnitude of the correction while the index $a$ specifies at which PN order the correction enters. One can write the non-GR phase correction $\delta\Psi$ in a similar manner as that of the amplitude as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2b}
\delta\Psi=\beta_{\PPE} u^b\,.
\end{equation}
Together $\left(\alpha_{\PPE},a\right)$ and $\left(\beta_{\PPE},b\right)$ are called the PPE parameters.


%Parametrization
PPE modifications in Eq.~\eqref{eq:2a} can enter through the non-GR corrections to the binding energy and the GW luminosity~\cite{Yunes:2009ke,Chatziioannou:2012rf}, or alternatively to the frequency evolution and the Kepler's law~\cite{Tahura:2018zuq}. We will follow the latter approach and write the modified Kepler's law as
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:2c}
 r=r_{\GR}(1+\gamma_r u^{c_r})\,,
 \end{equation}
and the frequency evolution as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2d}
\dot{f}=\dot{f}_{\GR}\left(1+\gamma_{\dot{f}}u^{c_{\dot{f}}}\right)\,.
\end{equation}
Here, $\lb\gamma_r,c_r\rb$ and $\lb\gamma_{\dot{f}},c_{\dot{f}}\rb$ parametrize the non-GR corrections to the binary separation $r$ and the frequency evolution $\dot{f}$ respectively. To leading PN order, the GR contribution is given by~\cite{cutlerflanagan,Blanchet:1995ez}
\begin{equation}
r_{\GR}=\left(\frac{m}{\Omega^2}\right)^{1/3}\,, \quad
\dot{f}_{\GR}=\frac{96}{5}\pi^{8/3}\mathcal{M}^{5/3}f^{11/3}\,,
\end{equation}
where $m$ represents the total mass of the binary and $\Omega=\pi f$ is the orbital angular frequency.

%Amplitude and phase correction
Utilizing the stationary phase approximation~\cite{PhysRevD.62.084036,Yunes:2009yz} and the quadrupole formula for the metric perturbation~\cite{Blanchet:2002av}, one can easily derive the amplitude and phase of the dominant quadrupolar mode in Fourier space from Eqs.~\eqref{eq:2c} and~\eqref{eq:2d} as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:amp}
\tilde{\mathcal{A}}(f)=\tilde{\mathcal{A}}_{\GR} \left(1+2\gamma_ru^{c_r}-\frac{1}{2}\gamma_{\dot{f}}u^{c_{\dot{f}}}\right)\,,
\end{equation}
and
\be
\label{eq:Psi}
\Psi = \Psi_\GR  -\frac{15 \text{$\gamma_{\dot{f}} $}}{16 (\text{$c_{\dot{f}}$}-8) (\text{$c_{\dot{f}}$}-5)} u^{c_{\dot{f}}-5}\,,
\ee
respectively. Eq.~\eqref{eq:Psi} is already in the PPE format, while  Eq.~\eqref{eq:amp} can be reduced to such a form by keeping only the dominant correction\footnote{A detailed derivation can be found in Ref.~\cite{Tahura:2018zuq}}.


%Relation among ppE parameters
In fact, the PPE phase and the amplitude parameters may be related as follows. If the dissipative correction dominates over the conservative one, we find
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2w2}
\alpha_{\PPE} = \frac{8}{15} (a-8)(a-5) \, \beta_{\PPE}\,,
\end{equation}
while for the conservative-dominanted case, we obtains
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2w3}
\alpha_{\PPE} =\frac{8}{15} \frac{(8-a)(5-a)(a^2-4a-6)}{a^2-2a-6} \beta_{\PPE}\,.
\end{equation}
On the other hand, when the aforementioned corrections enter at the same PN order, no direct relation between $\alpha_{\PPE}$ and $\beta_{\PPE}$ exists. The exponents $a$ and $b$ in the correction terms are related by the following equation which is valid for all three cases:
\begin{equation}
b=a-5\,.
\end{equation}


%Varying-G
The above formalism needs to be slightly modified for theories containing time-varying gravitational constants. Variations in the gravitational constants cause the masses  of the binary components to vary as well~\cite{PhysRevLett.65.953}, and one needs to take this into account when deriving the PPE parameters~\cite{Tahura:2018zuq}.
%The derivation of PPE parameters for such theories can be found in Ref.~\cite{Tahura:2018zuq}






%Amplitude Correction
%Let us first derive the PPE correction to the GW amplitude. One can employ the stationary phase approximation~\cite{PhysRevD.62.084036,Yunes:2009yz} and write the amplitude of the dominant quadrupolar radiation in Fourier domain as
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:2e}
%\tilde{\mathcal{A}}(f)=\frac{A(\bar{t})}{2\sqrt{\dot{f}}}\,,
%\end{equation}
%where $A(\bar{t})$ is the GW amplitude in time domain with $\bar{t}$ representing the time corresponding to the stationary phase. $\mathcal{A}(\bar t)$ can be obtained from the quadrupole formula for the metric %perturbation~\cite{Blanchet:2002av},
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:2f}
%h^{ij}(t)\propto \frac{d^2 }{d t^2}Q^{ij}\,.
 %\end{equation}
%Here, $h^{ij}$ and $Q^{ij}$ are the $(i,j)$ components of the metric perturbation and the quadruple moment tensor respectively. For a quasi-circular binary one obtains $A(\bar{t})\propto \mu r^2f^2$ from Eq.~\eqref{eq:2f}, which after substituting to Eq.~\eqref{eq:2e} gives
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:2g}
%\tilde{\mathcal{A}}(f) \propto\frac{r^2}{\sqrt{\dot{f}}}  \,.
%\end{equation}
%Using Eq.~\eqref{eq:2c} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:2d} to Eq.~\eqref{eq:2g} one obtains, to the leading order in non-GR corrections,
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:2h}
%\tilde{\mathcal{A}}(f)=\tilde{\mathcal{A}}_{\GR} \left(1+2\gamma_ru^{c_r}-\frac{1}{2}\gamma_{\dot{f}}u^{c_{\dot{f}}}\right)\,.
%\end{equation}
%Here $\tilde{\mathcal{A}}_{\GR} $ is the amplitude of the Fourier waveform in GR. Comparing Eq.~\eqref{eq:2g} with Eq.~\eqref{eq:2a} one can read off the PPE amplitude parameters for three different cases in the following way:
%\begin{itemize}

%\item
%\emph{Dissipative-dominated Case:}
%When dissipative corrections dominate, non-GR corrections to the binary separation is negligible and one can set $\gamma_{r} = 0$. Then the PPE parameters are given by
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:2t}
%\alpha_{\PPE}=-\frac{\gamma_{\dot{f}}}{2},\quad a=c_{\dot{f}}\,.
%\end{equation}

%\item
%\emph{Conservative-dominated Case}
%When conservative corrections dominate, $c_r = c_{\dot f}$ and there is an explicit relation between $\gamma_{r}$ and $\gamma_{\dot f}$. Though finding such a relation is quite involved and one needs to go back to the original PPE formalism as explained in App.~\ref{appendix}. Non-GR corrections to the GW amplitude in such a formalism is shown in Eq.~\eqref{eq:o}. Setting the dissipative correction to zero, one finds 
%\begin{align}\label{eq:2u}
%\alpha_{\PPE}=-\frac{\gamma_r}{a}(a^2-4a-6)\,, \quad a=c_r = c_{\dot f}\,.
%\end{align} 
%\item
%\emph{Comparable Dissipative and Conservative Case}
%When dissipative and conservative corrections enter at the same PN order, $c_r=c_{\dot{f}}$ and one finds
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:amp-ppE-comparable}
%\alpha_{\PPE}=2 \text{$\gamma_r $}-\frac{\text{$\gamma_{\dot{f}} $}}{2}\,, \quad a=c_{r}=c_{\dot{f}}\,.
%\end{equation}
%\end{itemize}


%-------------------
\subsection{Data Analysis Formalism}\label{data}

%Fisher Analysis
%%Assumptions
We adopt a Fisher analysis~\cite{Cutler:1994ys} to estimate the statistical errors of the non-GR parameters in various theories. Such an analysis is valid for GW events with sufficiently large signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios. We make the assumptions that the detector noise is Gaussian and stationary. Let us write the detector output as
\be
s(t)=n(t)+h(t)\,,
\ee
where $n(t)$ and $h(t)$ are the noise and the GW signal respectively. Let us also define the inner product of two quantities $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ as
 \be
 \left(A|B\right)=4\Re\int_0^\infty df \frac{\tilde{A}^*(f)\tilde{B}(f)}{S_n \left( f \right)}\,.
 \ee
Here $\tilde{A}(f)$ is the Fourier component of $A$, an asterisk ($*$) superscript means the complex conjugate and $S_n\left(f\right)$ is the noise spectral density. With the above definitions, the probability distribution of the noise can be written as
 \be
P\left(n=n_0(t)\right) \propto \text{exp}\left[-\left(n_0|n_0\right)\right]\,,
\ee
and the SNR for a given signal $h(t)$ can be defined as
\be
\rho \equiv\sqrt{\left(h|h\right)}\,.
\ee
Under the assumptions of a Gaussian and stationary noise, the posterior probability distribution of binary parameters $\theta^a$ takes the following form:
\be
P\left(\theta^a|s\right) \propto p^{(0)}\left(\theta^a\right) \text{exp}\left[-\frac{1}{2} \Gamma_{ab} \Delta\theta^a\Delta \theta^b \right]\,,
\ee
where $\Delta \theta^a=\hat{\theta}^a-\theta^a$ with $\hat{\theta}^a$ being the maximum likelihood values of $\theta^a$. $p^{(0)}\left(\theta^a\right)$ gives the probability distribution of the prior information, which we take to be in a Gaussian form for simplicity. $\Gamma_{ab}$ is called the Fisher information matrix which is defined as
\be
\Gamma_{ab}=\left(\partial_a h|\partial_b h \right)\,,
\ee
where $\partial_b\equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta^b}$. One can estimate the root-mean-square of $\Delta \theta^a$ by taking the square root of the diagonal elements of the inverse Fisher matrix $\Sigma^{ab}$: 
\be
\Sigma^{ab}=\left(\tilde{\Gamma}^{-1}\right)^{ab}=\langle\Delta\theta^a\Delta \theta^b\rangle\,,
\ee
where $\tilde{\Gamma}_{ab}$ is defined by
\be
p^{(0)}\left(\theta^a\right) \text{exp}\left[-\frac{1}{2} \Gamma_{ab} \Delta\theta^a\Delta \theta^b \right]=\text{exp}\left[-\frac{1}{2} \tilde{\Gamma}_{ab} \Delta\theta^a\Delta \theta^b \right]\,.
\ee

%%binary parameters
We choose the following parameters as our variables for the Fisher analysis:
\bw
\ba\label{parameters}
\theta^a\equiv \lb \ln{\mathcal{M}_z}, \ln{\eta}, \ln{D_L}, \ln{t_0}, \chi, \phi_0, \alpha, \delta, \psi, \theta_{\text{inc}}, \beta_{\PPE}, \alpha_{\PPE} \rb\,.
\ea
\ew
Here, $\mathcal{M}_z$ is the the redshifted chirp mass and $\chi$ is the effective spin parameter~\footnote{The effective spin parameter is defined as $\chi\equiv\lb m_1 \chi_1+m_2\chi_2\rb /\lb m_1+m_2\rb$, where $\chi_A$ with $A=(1,2)$ is the dimensionless spin of the $A$th body.}. $\alpha, \delta, \psi$, and  $\theta_{\text{inc}}$ are the right ascension, declination, polarization and inclination angles respectively in the detector frame.
%All other parameters have the same meanings as in Sec.~\ref{section:method}. 
%Monte-Carlo
We perform a Monte Carlo simulation by using each set of the posterior samples released by LIGO~\cite{ligo:sample} for $(\mathcal{M}_z, \eta, D_L, \chi, \alpha, \delta$, $\theta_{\text{inc}})$, while we randomly sample the polarization angle $\psi$ and the coalescence phase $\phi_0$ in $[0,\pi]$ and $[0,2\pi]$ respectively.
%%prior on spin
We impose the prior information such that $-1 \leq \chi \leq 1$, $-\pi \leq (\phi_0, \alpha, \psi) \leq \pi$, and $-\pi/2 \leq ( \delta, \theta_{\text{inc}}) \leq \pi/2$.

%Detectors
We use the detector sensitivity of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) O1 run~\cite{LIGOScientific:2018mvr} and we consider the two detectors at Hanford and Livingstone. For simplicity, we assume that the Livingstone noise spectrum is identical to that of the Hanford~\cite{Yunes:2009yz}. For Fisher integration, the minimum frequency is taken to be 20 Hz while the maximum frequency is same as the cutoff frequency above which the signal power is negligible~\cite{Ajith:2009bn}.


%The rule of compound probability
Now we are going to discuss how we achieve the probability distribution of a non-GR parameter from the output of a Fisher analysis with a Monte Carlo simulation. We set the  fiducial value of any non-GR parameter to be zero for our analysis. We perform the following integration numerically to obtain the compound probability density function~\footnote{If the distribution of a random variable $y$ depends on a parameter $x$, and if $x$ is not fixed rather a random variable, the marginal distribution of $y$ is called mixture distribution or compound probability distribution and is given by $P\left(y\right)=\int P\left(y|x\right) P\left(x\right)dx$. The underlying distribution $P\left(x\right)$ is called mixing distribution or latent distribution.~\cite{2016arXiv160204060R}} of any parameter $\xi$~:
\be
\label{eq3:1}
P\lb\xi\rb=\int P\lb \xi|\sigma_{\xi}\rb P\lb \sigma_{\xi}\rb d\sigma_{\xi}\,,
\ee
where $P\lb\xi\rb$ is the marginal (unconditional) probability density function of $\xi$. $P\lb \xi|\sigma_{\xi}\rb \propto \exp[-(\xi-\bar \xi)^2/2\sigma_{\xi}^2]$ is the conditional probability density function of $\xi$ which we assume to be a Gaussian distribution with a mean $\bar \xi$ and a standard deviation $\sigma_\xi$. $P\lb\sigma_\xi\rb$ is the probability distribution of $\sigma_\xi$ computed from the Fisher analysis for the entire posterior distribution.
%We perform the integration in Eq.~\ref{eq3:1} numerically to obtain the unconditional probability density function $P\lb\xi\rb$.


%Combining amplitude and phase corrections
Let us finish this section by explaining how we can utilize both amplitude and phase corrections to derive constraints on some theory. One can include $\alpha_{\PPE}$ and $\beta_{\PPE}$ as variables to the Fisher analysis as in Eq.~\eqref{parameters} and map them to a non-GR parameter of a theory to derive constraints from the phase and amplitude independently. We refer to such constraints as  the ``phase-only'' and ``amplitude-only'' bounds respectively. How can we achieve a single constraint that accommodates both of them? Recall the relations between the PPE parameters in Sec.~\ref{section:ppE}. One can rewrite $\alpha_{\PPE}$ in the waveform in terms of $\beta_{\PPE}$ according to Eqs.~\eqref{eq:2w2} or~\eqref{eq:2w3} and eliminate the former variable from the analysis. The bound derived from $\beta_{\PPE}$ now takes into account non-GR corrections to not only the phase but also the amplitude. We refer to such constraints as the ``phase \& amplitude combined'' bounds.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Results in Example Theories}

We now apply our analysis to some example theories. To save computational time for our Monte-Carlo simulations, we use IMRPhenomB waveform. For corrections entering through propagation mechanisms, Ref.~\cite{Yunes:2016jcc} showed that the difference in constraints on PPE parameters between IMRPhenomB and IMRPhenomD waveforms are negligible. In App.~\ref{Appendix}, we perform a similar comparison for generation mechanism corrections using sky-averaged waveforms and show that the former is only suitable for constraining generation mechanisms that enter at negative PN orders. For this reason, we consider below massive gravity, EdGB gravity, scalar-tensor theories and varying-$G$ theories. While in Massive gravity acquires non-GR corrections through propagation mechanisms while others achieve the corrections through generation mechanisms entering at negative PN orders.



\subsection{Massive Gravity}
\label{sec:massive}
%Intro
The idea of introducing the mass to gravitons is rather old~\cite{Fierz:1939ix} and many attempts have been made to construct a feasible theory that allows to do so~\cite{deRham:2014zqa}.  Such a theory may arise in higher-dimensional setups~\cite{Hinterbichler:2011tt} and has the potential to solve the cosmic acceleration problem~\cite{deRham:2014zqa}. Although gravitons with non-vanishing masses may have additional polarizations as well~\cite{dePaula:2004bc}, we here restrict our attention to the non-GR effects on the tensor modes due to a massive dispersion relation.

%such as Fierz-Pauli theory and Lorentz violating massive gravity~\cite{Fierz:1939ix,Rubakov:2008nh,Rubakov:2004eb,Dubovsky:2004sg}.


%PPE parameters
We will focus on the non-GR corrections specifically to the GW phase. Thus, the purpose of this section is simply to compare our Fisher analysis with the Bayesian one performed by the LVC. Gravitons with a non-vanishing mass travel at a speed smaller than the speed of light and the non-GR effects accumulate over the distance. Modified dispersion relation for such gravitons is given by $ E^2=p^2c^2+m_g^2c^4$, where $m_g$ is the mass of the graviton while $E$ and $p$ are the energy and the momentum respectively. The PPE phase parameters are~\cite{Will:1997bb}
\be
\beta=\frac{\pi^2}{\lambda_g^2}\frac{\mathcal{M}}{1+z}D\,, \qquad \qquad b=3\,,
\ee
where
\be
D=\frac{z}{H_0\sqrt{\Omega_M+\Omega_{\Lambda}}}\left[1-\frac{z}{4}\left(\frac{3\Omega_M}{\Omega_M+\Omega_{\Lambda}} \right )+\mathcal{O}(z^2)\right]\,.
\ee
Here, $\Omega_M$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$ are the energy density of matter and dark energy respectively. $H_0$ is the Hubble constant while $z$ is the redshift of the source. $\lambda_g$ is the Compton wavelength of the graviton that is related to $m_g$ as $\lambda_g\equiv h/\lb m_gc\rb$, where $h$ is the Planck's constant.

%Result
We compute the probability distribution of $\lambda_g$ from GW150914 according to the procedure outlined in Sec.~\ref{section:method} and compare with the one obtained by the LVC~\cite{TheLIGOScientific:2016src} (Fig.~\ref{fig:graviton}). The Fisher analysis with Monte Carlo simulation yields $\lambda_g<1.2\times 10^{13}$ km at 90\% CL which is in a good agreement with the LVC bound of $1.0\times10^{13}$ km. The difference in the two cumulative distributions of $\lambda_g$ presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:graviton} can be attributed to the fact that the LVC used a more accurate Baysian analysis and imposed a uniform prior on the graviton mass.
%assuming a standard \text{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology.
The GW bound has recently been updated by combining multiple events~\cite{LIGOScientific:2019fpa}. The new bound is stronger than binary pulsar constraints~\cite{Finn:2001qi,Miao:2019nhf} but slightly weaker than the updated solar system bounds~\cite{Will:2018gku}. The bound is also weaker than the ones from the observations of galactic clusters~\cite{Goldhaber:1974wg}, gravitational lensing~\cite{Choudhury:2002pu}, and the absence of superradiant instability in supermassive black holes~\cite{Brito:2013wya}.

\subsection{Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity}
%Introduction
%%Importance
EdGB gravity endows one of the simplest high-energy modification to GR~\cite{Moura:2006pz,Pani:2009wy}. Such a theory is motivated from low-energy effective string theories and also arises as a special case of Horndeski gravity~\cite{Zhang:2017unx,Berti:2015itd}. 
%%Definition
The EdGB action is given by introducing a quadratic-curvature correction (Gauss-Bonnet invariant) to the GR action that is non-minimally coupled to a scalar field (dilaton) with a coupling constant $\bar{\alpha}_\EDGB$~\cite{Kanti:1995vq}\footnote{We use barred quantities for coupling constants in order to distinguish them from the PPE parameters.}.

%ppE parameters
In EdGB gravity, BHs acquire scalar monopole charges which may generate scalar dipole radiation if they form binaries~\cite{Yagi:2011xp,Sotiriou:2014pfa,Berti:2018cxi,Prabhu:2018aun}. Such radiation leads to an earlier coalescence of BH binaries compared to that of GR and modifies the gravitational waveform with the PPE parameters given by~\cite{Yunes:2016jcc,Yagi:2011xp}
\begin{equation}
 \beta_\EDGB=-\frac{5}{7168}\zeta_\EDGB\frac{(m_1^2\tilde s_2^\EDGB-m_2^2\tilde s_1^\EDGB)^2}{m^4\eta^{18/5}}\,,
 \end{equation}
 with $b=-7$ and 
  \begin{equation}
 \alpha_\EDGB=-\frac{5}{192}\zeta_\EDGB\frac{(m_1^2 \tilde s_2^\EDGB-m_2^2 \tilde s_1^\EDGB)^2}{m^4\eta^{18/5}}\,,
 \end{equation}
 with $a=-2$.  Here, $\zeta_\EDGB\equiv 16 \pi \bar{\alpha}_\EDGB^2/m^4$ is the dimensionless EdGB coupling parameter and $\tilde s_{A}^\EDGB$ are the spin-dependent factors of the BH scalar charges given by $\tilde s_{A}^\EDGB\equiv 2(\sqrt{1-{\chi_A}^2}-1+{\chi_A}^2)/{\chi_A}^2~$~\cite{Berti:2018cxi,Prabhu:2018aun}\footnote{For ordinary stars like NSs $\tilde s_A^\EDGB$ are zero~\cite{Yagi:2011xp,Yagi:2015oca}.}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{histogram-gw150914.pdf}
\caption{Histogram distributions of the 90\% CL bounds on $\zeta_{\EDGB}$ from a Fisher analysis with the phase correction only (blue solid), the amplitude correction only (red dashed) and combining the two corrections (green dotted-dashed). Fiducial values are taken from the posterior samples of GW150914. The samples that lie on the left side of the vertical black dashed line satisfy the small coupling approximation with 90\% CL.}
\label{fig:histogram-edgb}
\end{figure}


%Small coupling approximation
We now derive constraints on EdGB gravity from GW150914 and GW151226. First we estimate how well those events satisfy the small coupling approximation $\zeta_{\EDGB}<1$. To do so, we extract the 90\% CL upper bound $\Delta\zeta_{\EDGB}$ from each sample of the posterior distribution of a particular event. We then create histograms with all the samples (see Fig.~\ref{fig:histogram-edgb}) and calculate the fraction satisfying $\Delta\zeta_{\EDGB}<1$.  For GW150914, 72\% (42\%) of the samples satisfy the small coupling approximation if $\Delta\zeta_{\EDGB}$ is derived from the phase (amplitude) correction, while 70\% of the posterior distribution satisfies such approximation if the phase and amplitude corrections are combined. A similar analysis with GW151226 gives 98\% and 87\% for the phase and amplitude corrections respectively while combining the two yields almost the same result as that of the phase-only case. Since the fraction of samples satisfying $\zeta_{\EDGB}<1$ is much higher for GW151226 than GW150914 due to a larger number of GW cycles and slower relative velocity of the binary constituents, the former event places more reliable constraints on EdGB gravity compared to the latter one.


\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{edgb-gw150914.pdf}
\caption{Cumulative probability distributions of $\bar{\alpha}^2_{\EDGB}$ obtained from GW150914 for the same three cases as in Fig.~\ref{fig:histogram-edgb}. Each vertical dashed line shows the corresponding 90\% CL upper bound of a solid line of the same color.}
\label{fig:pdf-edgb}
\end{figure}


%Results
Figure~\ref{fig:pdf-edgb} presents cumulative probability distributions of $\bar{\alpha}^2_{\EDGB}$\footnote{We show the distribution of $\bar{\alpha}^2_{\EDGB}$ instead of $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{\EDGB}}$ as it is the former that directly enters in the waveform.} for GW150914 for three different cases with vertical lines showing the 90\% CL of the corresponding distribution. We found the 90\% CL constraints on  $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{\EDGB}}$ from each of the phase and amplitude corrections as 50.5 km and 76.3 km respectively. Notice that these bounds have the same order of magnitude. On the other hand, combining the amplitude and phase corrections leads to an upper bound of 51.5 km, which is weaker than the  phase-only constraint by 2\%.
Similar analyses with GW151226 yield 4.3 km and 10.5 km respectively from the phase and amplitude corrections,
%\footnote{The upper bound on $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{\EDGB}}$ derived from the phase correction with GW151226 agrees with those of ref.~\cite{Nair:2019iur} and~\cite{Yamada:2019zrb}}, 
while \kent{combining the two only changes the result from including only the phase correction by 0.01\%.} \sout{the difference between the phase-only case and the combined analysis  is only 0.01\%. As we can see,} 
These bounds are consistent with those in a recent paper~\cite{Nair:2019iur} while Ref.~\cite{Yamada:2019zrb} found even stronger bounds by combining multiple GW events. These GW bounds are comparable to the one obtained from low-mass X-ray binaries~\cite{Yagi:2012gp}.
Although GW150914 leads to weaker constraints on EdGB gravity compared to GW151226, the effect of amplitude correction is more manifest for the former event. \kent{This is because GW150914 has a smaller number of GW cycles and thus the amplitude contribution becomes relatively higher than GW151226.}

\ky{I added this paragraph.}
Why does the inclusion of the amplitude correction deteriorates the bound slightly from the case where one only includes the phase correction? This may sound counter-intuitive as one might think adding more EdGB corrections should improve the bound. Indeed, if one neglects correlations among $\bar \alpha^2_\EDGB$ and other binary parameters, addition of the amplitude correction improves the bound. However, such amplitude correction introduces a strong correlation between $\bar \alpha^2_\EDGB$ and the luminosity distance. As a result, the bound derived by including both the amplitude and phase corrections becomes weaker than that from the latter only.

\subsection{Scalar-Tensor Theories}
%Intro
Scalar-Tensor theories of gravity emerge from the dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional theories such as the Kaluza-Klein theory~\cite{Fujii:2003pa,Overduin:1998pn} and string theories~\cite{polchinski1,polchinski2}. In addition to the spacetime curvature, scalar fields mediate an additional force which is introduced through non-minimal couplings of scalar fields and gravity~\cite{Berti:2015itd,Chiba:1997ms,PhysRevD.6.2077}. Such theories can explain the accelerated expansion of the universe~\cite{Brax:2004qh,PhysRevD.73.083510,PhysRevD.62.123510,PhysRevD.66.023525,Schimd:2004nq}, inflation~\cite{Burd:1991ns,Barrow:1990nv,Clifton:2011jh}, primordial nucleosynthesis~\cite{Coc:2006rt,Damour:1998ae,Larena:2005tu,Torres:1995je}, and the structure formation~\cite{Brax:2005ew}. 

%PPE parameters
Certain scalar-tensor theories predict scalarization of NSs~\cite{PhysRevLett.70.2220,Barausse:2012da}, which can also happen for BHs if the scalar field evolves with time cosmologically~\cite{Jacobson:1999vr,Horbatsch:2011ye}. Compact binaries formed by such objects emit dipole radiation which modifies the GW phase with~\cite{Freire:2012mg,Wex:2014nva,Tahura:2018zuq}
\be\label{eq:betaST}
\beta_{\ST}=-\frac{5}{7168}\eta ^{2/5}(\alpha_1-\alpha_2)^2
\ee
with $b=-7$, and the GW amplitude as~\cite{Tahura:2018zuq}
\be\label{eq:alphaST}
\alpha_{\ST}=-\frac{5}{192}\eta ^{2/5}(\alpha_1-\alpha_2)^2
\ee
with $a=-2$. Here $\alpha_A$ represents the scalar charge of the $A$th binary component and depends on specific theories and the type of compact objects. If we consider a binary consisting of BHs in a theory where the scalar field $\phi$ obeys a massless Klein-Gordon equation, $\alpha_A$ is given by~\cite{Horbatsch:2011ye}
\be\label{eq:alpha_A}
\alpha_A = 2 \, m_A \, \dot \phi\, [1+(1-\chi_A^2)^{1/2}]\,,
\ee
where $\dot{\phi}$ is the rate of change of $\phi$ with time.

%Results
One can use Eqs.~\eqref{eq:betaST}--\eqref{eq:alpha_A} and the numerical anlaysis described in Sec.~\ref{data} to find constraints on $\dot{\phi}$ as long as the small coupling approximation $m_A\dot{\phi}<1$ is satisfied. In this regard, only 11.5\% (13.7\%) of the samples of GW150914 satisfies such approximation with 90\% confidence level for the phase (combined) correction, while all of the samples fail to do so for the amplitude correction. Hence GW150914 cannot place any meaningful bound on scalar-tensor theories considered here. On the other hand, 90.4\% of the samples from GW151226 meets the small coupling criterion for the phase-only and combined analyses, while the fraction is only 25\% for the amplitude correction. Thus, we derive reliable constraints from GW151226 with the phase-only and combined analyses and both lead to $\dot{\phi}<1.1\times10^4$/sec\footnote{A previous analysis with the sky-averaged waveform in Ref.~\cite{Yunes:2016jcc} could not place a reliable bound on scalar-tensor theories. Since the posterior distributions of the GW events were not available then, one could not determine how well those events satisfied the small coupling approximation from a simple Fisher analysis.}. This constraint is 10 orders of magnitude weaker than the current most stringent bound obtained from the orbital decay rate of quasar OJ287~\cite{Horbatsch:2011ye}, though this is the first bound obtained in the strong/dynamical regime.


\subsection{Varying- $G$ Theories}
%Introduction
Many metric theories of gravity that violate strong equivalence principle~\cite{DiCasola:2013iia,Will:2014kxa,0264-9381-7-10-007} predicts time variation in the gravitational coupling parameter $G$~\cite{uzan:2010pm}. Scalar-tensor theories are examples where $G$ varies as a function of the asymptotic scalar field~\cite{Will2006}, which may vary over time. Any such time-dependence of $G$ leads to a variation in the effective masses of compact bodies, which in turn makes them experience anomalous cosmic acceleration~\cite{PhysRevLett.65.953}. Such phenomena alter the gravitational waveform through the modifications of the binary orbital evolution and the energy balance law~\cite{Tahura:2018zuq}.

%PPE parameters
We now show the PPE modifications due to a time variation in the gravitational constant. In fact, the amount of gravitational coupling that appear in different sectors of a  gravitational theory may not be unique. Einstein-\AE ther theory~\cite{Yagi:2013ava} and Brans-Dicke theory with a cosmologically evolving scalar field~\cite{Will2006} are examples of such theories in which various gravitational constants exist. Reference~\cite{Tahura:2018zuq} studied a generic case with two distinct gravitational constants in Kepler's law (conservative sector) and GW luminosity (dissipative sector). Here we place constraints on the special case where these two constants coincide with each other. Let the masses and the Newton's constant vary according to the following equations:
 \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:gdot-1}
 m_A(t)\approx m_{A,0}+\dot{m}_{A,0}(t-t_0)\,, \\\label{eq:gdot-2}
   \label{eq:3.7a4}  G(t)\approx  G_{0}+\dot{G}_{0}(t-t_0)\,.
  % \label{eq:3.7a4-2}  G_D(t)\approx  G_{D,0}+(1+\delta_\Gdot)\dot{G}_{C,0}(t-t_0)\, , 
 \end{eqnarray}
 Here, a subscript $0$ denotes that the quantity is measured at the time $t=t_0$, and an overhead dot means a derivative with respect to time. Eqs.~\eqref{eq:gdot-1} and~\eqref{eq:gdot-2} modify the GW phase and amplitude as~\cite{Tahura:2018zuq}
%PPE parameters
 \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:beta_gdot}
 \beta_{\dot{G}}&=&-\frac{25}{851968}\dot{G}_{C,0}\,\eta_0^{3/5}\left[11m_0 +3(s_{1,0}+s_{2,0}-\delta_\Gdot)m_0 \right. \nonumber \\
 && \left. -41 (m_{1,0}s_{1,0}+m_{2,0}s_{2,0})\right]\,
  \end{eqnarray} 
with $b=-13$, and 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:alpha_gdot}
\label{eq:3.7d2}
 \alpha_{\dot{G}}&=&\frac{5}{512}\eta_0^{3/5}\dot{G}_{C,0}\left[-7m_0+(s_{1,0}+s_{2,0}-\delta_\Gdot)m_0 \right. \nonumber \\
 && \left.+13 (m_{1,0}s_{1,0}+m_{2,0}s_{2,0})\right]\, 
 \end{eqnarray}
with $a=-8$ respectively. Here $s_A$ is the sensitivity of the $A$th binary component.
 
%Results
Employing Eqs.~\eqref{eq:beta_gdot} and~\eqref{eq:alpha_gdot}, GW150914 (GW151226) imposes constraints on $|\dot{G_0}/G_0|$ from the phase-only and amplitude-only analyses as $1.2\times10^7\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ ($3.6\times10^5\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) and $1.8\times10^8\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ ($6\times10^7\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) respectively, with the combined analyses yielding slight improvements over the phase-only results.
These bounds are much less stringent compared to the other contemporary constraints~\cite{Will2006}. 
However, future space-borne detectors such as LISA~\cite{Seoane:2013qna,Audley:2017drz} will be able to obtain constraints up to 13 orders of magnitude stronger compared to  the aLIGO ones~\cite{Yunes:2009bv,Chamberlain:2017fjl}.
%The most stringent bound on $|\dot{G}/G|$ is of the order $\lesssim 10^{-14} \,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$~\cite{2018NatCo...9..289G}.


\section{Conclusion and Discussion}
%What we did
We derived constraints on scalar-tensor, EdGB and varying-$G$ theories from GW150914 and GW151226. To do so we performed Fisher analyses with Monte-Carlo simulations using the PhenomB waveform.
%We focused on theories where the leading correction enters at a negative PN order.
In particular, we derived reliable constraints on \kent{the time-evolution of the scalar field in} \ky{I added this since bounds on ST from GWs have been placed from the GW speed bound with GW170817 in a different context.} scalar-tensor theory from GW observations for the first time. 
%massive gravity?


%Amplitude correction
We explored how amplitude corrections contribute to the constraints on such theories. We derived three set of bounds on each theory: phase-only, amplitude-only, and combined.
%Most of the previous work on testing gravity with GWs were focused on phase corrections only since matched filtering is more sensitive to phase corrections.
We found that for binaries with large masses, such as GW150914 where we have less number of cycles, the bounds from the amplitude and phase can be comparable to each other.
%Also, a combined analysis where we include no-GR corrections to both phase and amplitude is more accurate compared to a phase-only analysis.
On the other hand, combined analyses yield constraints that differ from the phase-only case at most by 3.6\% for the theories under consideration. Hence at least in theories where the leading corrections enter at negative PN orders, the phase-only corrections can produce sufficiently accurate constraints.
\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{combinedvsphase.pdf}
\caption{Comparision of combined and phase-only analyses at different PN orders from GW150914 with a sky-averaged waveform. We show $\delta_{\beta}=\lb\beta_{\text{comb}}-\beta_{\text{phase}}\rb/\beta_{\text{phase}}$, where $\beta_{\text{phase}}$ and $\beta_{\text{comb}}$ are $\beta_{\PPE}$ from phase-only and combined analyses respectively. }
\label{fig:combinedvsphase}
\end{figure}

%whether combined analyses give better bound
Depending on the prior information and the PN order of the non-GR correction, a combined analysis can yield stronger or weaker constraint compared to a phase-only one. With the priors mentioned in Sec.~\ref{data}, the fractional difference between $\beta_{\PPE}$ for the two cases is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:combinedvsphase}. From $-4$ PN to $-2.5$ PN correction, the combined analyses give rise to slight improvements over the phase-only constraints, while for other cases, the former is weaker with a maximum deterioration of 8.5\% at $-1$ PN order. Nonetheless, \kent{it would be safer to include both phase and amplitude corrections in the analysis as a lack of the former}
\sout{the combined analyses are more reliable since amplitude corrections} in the \kent{template} waveform may cause \sout{more uncertainty in} \kent{systematic errors on GR parameters such as} luminosity distance \kent{if non-GR corrections exist in nature}.

%\section{Constraining PPE parameters with PhenomB and PhenomD Waveforms}\label{Appendix}
\section{Comparison of Bounds on PPE parameters with PhenomB and PhenomD Waveforms}\label{Appendix}

%Introduction
Despite the fact that the PhenomD waveform produces more accurate results, we utilized the PhenomB one in this paper throughout since the latter is simpler and saves computational time when performing Monte Carlo simulations. In this appendix, we compare constraints on the PPE parameter $\alpha_\PPE$ from both waveforms to justify our method. 
 
 %Comparison of waveforms
Let us discuss the distinct features of the two waveforms first. Both PhenomB and PhenomD waveforms are spin-aligned (non-precessing) frequency-domain phenomenological models of gravitational waveforms~\cite{Ajith:2009bn,Khan:2015jqa}. The PhenomB waveform is calibrated for mass ratios up to $m_1/m_2 = 4$ and spin components of $\chi_i\in[-0.85,0.85]$ are unified into a single effective spin. On the other hand, the PhenomD waveform covers a larger region of the parameter space with a mass ratio of 18 and spins of $\chi_i\in[-0.95,0.95]$ with both spins introduced independently. The waveform  contains higher order PN terms in the inspiral and further introduces an intermediate phase connecting the inspiral and merger-ringdown portions,
%Moreover, the PhenomD amplitude and phase are continuous over the inspiral, merger and  ringdown stages, while in PhenomB the continuity is ensured only in the amplitude. 
which make such waveforms more reliable than the PhenomB ones.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{phenomBvsphenomD.pdf}
\caption{Comparison of 90\% confidence constraints on $\alpha_{\PPE}$ from GW1501914 with PhenomB and PhenomD waveforms for generation effects. }

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{phenomBvsphenomD-insp.pdf}
\caption{Similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:phenomBvsD} but with inspirals only. The Fisher analyses are truncated at 104Hz which is the transition frequency between inspiral and merger of the PhenomB waveform, and we use the inspiral portion of the PhenomD waveform all the way up to this cutoff frequency.}
\label{fig:phenomBvsD-insp}
\end{figure}

%Amplitude corrction
We now estimate the constraints on the PPE amplitude modification from the two waveforms. Since modifications to propagation mechanisms used for massive gravity in Sec.~\ref{sec:massive} do not give rise to amplitude corrections, we here focus on modifications to generation mechanisms. We performed Fisher analyses with sky-averaged PhenomB and PhenomD waveforms and derived upper bounds on $\alpha_{\PPE}$ at different PN orders. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phenomBvsD}, the results from the two waveforms agree very well at negative PN corrections but deviate from each other at the positive ones. 
%Removing the higher order GR terms from PhenomD to match with that of PhenomB does not change the outcome, which eliminates such terms as sources of discrepancy.
On the other hand, truncating the Fisher analyses at the end of the inspiral phase shows significant agreement between the two waveforms at positive PN orders (Fig.~\ref{fig:phenomBvsD-insp}), suggesting that the deviation in Fig.~\ref{fig:phenomBvsD} originates mainly from the intermediate/merger-ringdown portion.

%Conclusion
The example theories considered in this paper acquire leading non-GR corrections either from propagation effects or from the generation effects entering in negative PN orders. A comparison between the PhenomB and PhenomD results for constraining $\beta_{\PPE}$ presented in Ref~\cite{Yunes:2016jcc} reveals consistency on constraining modifications to propagation mechanisms at both positive and negative PN orders, while the two waveforms show agreement only at negative PN orders for constraining modifications to generation mechanisms. Together with the results on amplitude corrections discussed above confirms that the results of this paper should not change significantly if one utilizes the PhenomD waveform instead. On the other hand, for constraining theories like dynamical Chern-Simons or noncommutative gravity where the leading correction enters at a positive PN order, the PhenomB waveform is not expected to produce reliable results.
