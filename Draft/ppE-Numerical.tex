\section{PPE Formalism}\label{section:ppE}

\section{Data Analysis Formalism}
%Fisher Analysis
%%Assumptions
We adopt a Fisher analysis~\cite{Cutler:1994ys} to estimate the statistical errors of the non-GR parameters in various theories. Such an analysis is valid for GW events with sufficiently large signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios. We make the assumptions that the detector noise is Gaussian and stationary. Let us write the detector output as
\be
s(t)=n(t)+h(t)\,,
\ee
where $n(t)$ and $h(t)$ are the noise and the GW signal respectively. Let us also define the inner product of two quantities $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ as
 \be
 \left(A|B\right)=4\Re\int_0^\infty df \frac{\tilde{A}^*(f)\tilde{B}(f)}{S_n \left( f \right)}\,.
 \ee
Here $\tilde{A}(f)$ is the Fourier component of $A$, an asterisk ($*$) superscript means the complex conjugate and $S_n\left(f\right)$ is the noise spectral density. With the above definitions, the probability distribution of the noise can be written as
 \be
P\left(n=n_0(t)\right) \propto \text{exp}\left[-\left(n_0|n_0\right)\right]\,,
\ee
and the SNR for a given signal $h(t)$ can be defined as
\be
\rho \equiv\sqrt{\left(h|h\right)}\,.
\ee
Under the assumptions of a Gaussian and stationary noise, the posterior probability distribution of binary parameters $\theta^a$ takes the following form:
\be
P\left(\theta^a|s\right) \propto p^{(0)}\left(\theta^a\right) \text{exp}\left[-\frac{1}{2} \Gamma_{ab} \Delta\theta^a\Delta \theta^b \right]\,,
\ee
where $\Delta \theta^a=\hat{\theta}^a-\theta^a$ with $\hat{\theta}^a$ being the maximum likelihood values of $\theta^a$. $p^{(0)}\left(\theta^a\right)$ gives the probability distribution of the prior information, \kent{which we take to be in a Gaussian form for simplicity}. $\Gamma_{ab}$ is called the Fisher information matrix which is defined as
\be
\Gamma_{ab}=\left(\partial_a h|\partial_b h \right)\,,
\ee
where $\partial_b\equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta^b}$. One can estimate the root-mean-square of $\Delta \theta^a$ by taking the square root of the diagonal elements of the inverse Fisher matrix $\Sigma^{ab}$: 
\be
\Sigma^{ab}=\left(\tilde{\Gamma}^{-1}\right)^{ab}=\langle\Delta\theta^a\Delta \theta^b\rangle\,,
\ee
where $\tilde{\Gamma}_{ab}$ is defined by
\be
p^{(0)}\left(\theta^a\right) \text{exp}\left[-\frac{1}{2} \Gamma_{ab} \Delta\theta^a\Delta \theta^b \right]=\text{exp}\left[-\frac{1}{2} \tilde{\Gamma}_{ab} \Delta\theta^a\Delta \theta^b \right]\,.
\ee

%%binary parameters
We choose the following parameters as our variables for the Fisher analysis:
\bw
\ba
\theta^a\equiv \lb \ln{\mathcal{M}_z}, \ln{\eta}, \ln{D_L}, \ln{t_0}, \chi, \phi_0, \alpha, \delta, \psi, \theta_{\text{inc}}, \beta_{\PPE}, \alpha_{\PPE} \rb\,.
\ea
\ew
Here, $\mathcal{M}_z$ is the the redshifted chirp mass and $\chi$ is the effective spin parameter~\footnote{The effective spin parameter is defined as $\chi\equiv\lb m_1 \chi_1+m_2\chi_2\rb /\lb m_1+m_2\rb$, where $\chi_A$ with $A=(1,2)$ is the dimensionless spin of the $A$th body.}. $\alpha, \delta, \psi$, and  $\theta_{\text{inc}}$ are the right ascension, declination, polarization and inclination angles respectively in the detector frame. All other parameters have the same meanings as in Sec.~\ref{section:ppE}. 
%Monte-Carlo
We perform a Monte Carlo simulation by using each set of the posterior samples released by LIGO~\cite{ligo:sample} for $(\mathcal{M}_z, \eta, D_L, \chi, \alpha, \delta$, $\theta_{\text{inc}})$, while we randomly sample the polarization angle $\psi$ and the coalescence phase $\phi_0$ in $[0,\pi]$ and $[0,2\pi]$ respectively.
%%prior on spin
We impose the prior information such that the effective spin is less than 1.

%%Detectors
We use the detector sensitivity of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) O1 run~\cite{LIGOScientific:2018mvr} and we consider the two detectors at Hanford and Livingstone. For simplicity, we assume that the Livingstone noise spectrum is identical to that of the Hanford~\cite{Yunes:2009yz}. For Fisher integration, the minimum frequency is taken to be 20 Hz while the maximum frequency is same as the cutoff frequency above which the signal power is negligible~\cite{Ajith:2009bn}.


%The rule of compound probability
Now we are going to discuss how we achieve the probability distribution of a non-GR parameter from the output of a Fisher analysis with a Monte Carlo simulation. We set the  fiducial value of any non-GR parameter to be zero for our analysis. We perform the following integration numerically to obtain the compound probability density function~\footnote{If the distribution of a random variable $y$ depends on a parameter $x$, and if $x$ is not fixed rather a random variable, the marginal distribution of $y$ is called mixture distribution or compound probability distribution and is given by $P\left(y\right)=\int P\left(y|x\right) P\left(x\right)dx$. The underlying distribution $P\left(x\right)$ is called mixing distribution or latent distribution.~\cite{2016arXiv160204060R}} of any parameter $\xi$~:
\be
\label{eq3:1}
P\lb\xi\rb=\int P\lb \xi|\sigma_{\xi}\rb P\lb \sigma_{\xi}\rb d\sigma_{\xi}\,,
\ee
where $P\lb\xi\rb$ is the marginal (unconditional) probability density function of $\xi$. $P\lb \xi|\sigma_{\xi}\rb \propto \exp[-(\xi-\bar \xi)^2/2\sigma_{\xi}^2]$ is the conditional probability density function of $\xi$ which we assume to be a Gaussian distribution with a mean $\bar \xi$ and a standard deviation $\sigma_\xi$. $P\lb\sigma_\xi\rb$ is the probability distribution of $\sigma_\xi$ computed from the Fisher analysis for the entire posterior distribution.
%We perform the integration in Eq.~\ref{eq3:1} numerically to obtain the unconditional probability density function $P\lb\xi\rb$.
\section{Example Theories}
\subsection{Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity}
%Introduction
%%Importance
EdGB gravity endows one of the simplest high-energy modification to GR~\cite{Moura:2006pz,Pani:2009wy}. Such a theory is motivated from low-energy effective string theories and also arises as a special case of Horndeski gravity~\cite{Zhang:2017unx,Berti:2015itd}. 
%%Definition
\sout{One obtains} The EdGB action \kent{is given by introducing} \sout{by adding} a quadratic-curvature correction \kent{(Gauss-Bonnet invariant)} to the GR action \sout{while the correction is achieved by} \kent{that is} non-minimally \kent{coupled to} a scalar field (dilaton) \sout{to the Gauss-Bonnet term} with a coupling constant $\bar{\alpha}_\EDGB$~\cite{Kanti:1995vq}\footnote{We use barred quantities for coupling constants in order to distinguish them from the PPE parameters.}.
%%Existing bounds

%ppE parameters
In EdGB gravity, BHs acquire scalar monopole charges which may generate scalar dipole radiation \kent{if they form binaries}~\cite{Yagi:2011xp,Sotiriou:2014pfa,Berti:2018cxi,Prabhu:2018aun}. Such radiation leads to an earlier coalescence of BH binaries compared to that of GR and modifies the \sout{GW phase} \kent{gravitational waveform} with the PPE parameters given by~\cite{Yunes:2016jcc,Yagi:2011xp}
\begin{equation}
 \beta_\EDGB=-\frac{5}{7168}\zeta_\EDGB\frac{(m_1^2\tilde s_2^\EDGB-m_2^2\tilde s_1^\EDGB)^2}{m^4\eta^{18/5}}\,,
 \end{equation}
 with $b=-7$ and 
  \begin{equation}
 \alpha_\EDGB=-\frac{5}{192}\zeta_\EDGB\frac{(m_1^2 \tilde s_2^\EDGB-m_2^2 \tilde s_1^\EDGB)^2}{m^4\eta^{18/5}}\,,
 \end{equation}
 with $a=-2$.  Here, $\zeta_\EDGB\equiv 16 \pi \bar{\alpha}_\EDGB^2/m^4$ is the dimensionless EdGB coupling parameter and $\tilde s_{A}^\EDGB$ are the spin-dependent factors of the BH scalar charges given by $\tilde s_{A}^\EDGB\equiv 2(\sqrt{1-{\chi_A}^2}-1+{\chi_A}^2)/{\chi_A}^2~$~\cite{Berti:2018cxi,Prabhu:2018aun}\footnote{For ordinary stars like NSs $\tilde s_A^\EDGB$ are zero~\cite{Yagi:2011xp,Yagi:2015oca}.}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{histogram-gw150914.eps}
\caption{Histogram distributions of \kent{the 90\% CL bounds on} $\zeta_{\EDGB}$ from \kent{a Fisher analysis with the phase correction only (blue solid), the amplitude correction only (red dashed) and combining the two corrections (green dotted-dashed).

The vertical axis shows the number of samples that produce a particular value of $\Delta\zeta_{\EDGB}$.} The samples that lie on the left side of the vertical black dashed line satisfy \kent{the} small coupling approximation with 90\% CL.}
\label{fig:histogram-edgb}
\end{figure}


%Small coupling approximation
We now derive constraints on EdGB gravity from GW150914 and GW151226. First we \sout{want to} estimate how well those events satisfy the small coupling approximation $\zeta_{\EDGB}<1$. \sout{In order to do that} \kent{To do so,} we extract the 90\% CL upper bound $\Delta\zeta_{\EDGB}$ from each sample of the posterior distribution of a particular event. \sout{Then} We \kent{then create} \sout{make a} histograms \sout{plot} with all the samples (see Fig.~\ref{fig:histogram-edgb}) and calculate the fraction \sout{of the samples} satisfying $\Delta\zeta_{\EDGB}<1$.  For GW150914, 72\% \kent{(40\%)} of the samples satisfy \kent{the} small coupling approximation if $\Delta\zeta_{\EDGB}$ is derived from \kent{the} phase \kent{(amplitude)} correction, while \sout{for amplitude correction it is only 42\%. On the other hand,} 70\% of the posterior distribution satisfies such approximation if \kent{the} phase and amplitude corrections are combined. A similar analysis with GW151226 gives 98\% and 87\% for the phase and amplitude corrections respectively while combining \sout{phase with amplitude produces} \kent{the two yields almost} the same result as that of the phase-only case. Since the fraction of samples satisfying $\zeta_{\EDGB}<1$ is much higher for GW151226 than GW150914 \kent{due to a larger number of GW cycles and slower relative velocity of binary constituents}, the former event places more reliable constraints on EdGB gravity compared to the latter one.

%Results
\kent{Figure~\ref{fig:pdf-edgb} presents cumulative probability distributions of $\bar{\alpha}^2_{\EDGB}$\footnote{\kent{We show the distribution of $\bar{\alpha}^2_{\EDGB}$ instead of $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{\EDGB}}$ as it is the former that directly enters in the waveform.}} for GW150914 for three different cases with vertical lines showing the 90\% CL of the corresponding distribution. We found}
\sout{Following the formula in Eq.~\eqref{eq3:1} we compute the probability distribution of $\bar{\alpha}^2_{\EDGB}$ for GW150914 (see Fig.~\ref{fig:pdf-edgb}) and extract} the 90\% CL constraints on  $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{\EDGB}}$ from \kent{each of} the phase and amplitude corrections as 50.5 km and 76.3 km respectively. Notice that these bounds \sout{from phase and amplitude} have the same order of magnitude. On the other hand, combining the amplitude and phase corrections leads to an upper bound of 51.5 km, which is \sout{larger} \kent{weaker} than the  phase-only constraint by 2\%.
Similar analyses with GW151226 yield 4.3 km and 10.5 km respectively from \kent{the} phase and amplitude \kent{corrections},
%\footnote{The upper bound on $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{\EDGB}}$ derived from the phase correction with GW151226 agrees with those of ref.~\cite{Nair:2019iur} and~\cite{Yamada:2019zrb}}, 
while \kent{combining the two only changes the result from including only the phase correction by 0.01\%.} \sout{the difference between the phase-only case and the combined analysis  is only 0.01\%. As we can see,} 
\kent{These bounds are consistent with those in a recent paper~\cite{Nair:2019iur} while Ref.~\cite{Yamada:2019zrb} found even stronger bounds by combining multiple GW events. These GW bounds are comparable to the one obtained from low-mass X-ray binaries~\cite{Yagi:2012gp}.}
Although GW150914 leads to \sout{worse} \kent{weaker} \ky{Try to avoid using ``good'' and ``bad'' but use more specific adjectives instead.} constraints on EdGB gravity compared to GW151226, the effect of amplitude correction is more manifest for the former event. \kent{This is because GW150914 has a smaller number of GW cycles and thus the amplitude contribution becomes relatively higher than GW151226.}

\ky{I added this paragraph.}
Why does the inclusion of the amplitude correction deteriorates the bound slightly from the case where one only includes the phase correction? This may sound counter-intuitive as one might think adding more EdGB corrections should improve the bound. Indeed, if one neglects correlations among $\bar \alpha^2_\EDGB$ and other binary parameters, addition of the amplitude correction improves the bound. However, such amplitude correction introduces a strong correlation between $\bar \alpha^2_\EDGB$ and the luminosity distance. As a result, the bound derived by including both the amplitude and phase corrections becomes weaker than that from the latter only.
